OpenHIM Load Testing
====================

Apache Jmeter is used to load test the OpenHIM. The .jmx file in this directory is the Apache JMeter project file for the OpenHIM. It allows the OpenHIM endpoints to be load tested by a number of users each requesting random endpoints consecutively using a gaussian based delay between each request.
