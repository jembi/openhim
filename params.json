{"name":"OpenHIM","tagline":"OpenHIM is a open source Health Information Mediator built to facilitate interoperability between disparate Health Information Systems.","body":"The Open Health Information Mediator (OpenHIM) is a middleware system based on an ESB architecture that aims to enable easier interoperability between disparate Health Information Systems.\r\n\r\nOur vision to build a community of implementers and developers that support this work so that we can ease the burden of implementing interoperability and help enable clinical information sharing between clinicians in real world projects.\r\n\r\nThe reference implementation of this is for the Rwandan Health Information Exchange (RHIE). This project is know as the RHEA (Rwandan Health Enterprise Architecture) project. Please see the RHEA wiki for more details about the current reference implementation and about the RHEA project in general:\r\n\r\n* [What is the HIM?](https://jembiprojects.jira.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10289633)\r\n* [Health Information Mediator Documentation](https://jembiprojects.jira.com/wiki/display/HIM/Health+Information+Mediator+-+Interoperability+Layer)\r\n* [RHEA Implementation wiki](https://jembiprojects.jira.com/wiki/display/RHEAPILOT/Home)\r\n\r\n## Get involved!\r\nIf you would like to ask some questions or hold some discussions around the OpenHIM project please feel free to contact us on the [OpenHIM Implementers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openhim-implementers). This group will be for people wanting to implement the OpenHIM software for thier own use case and for discussion of how you can start using this project now. Currently the software to pretty specific to the Rwandan use case but it is designed to be more generally applicable and that will be a major focal point for development going forward.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to get involved with this project, more technical developer discussions will take place on the [OpenHIM Developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openhim-dev). Also, please visit us on github (https://github.com/jembi/openhim) to find out how to get setup and test out the project.\r\n\r\nFor further development of the OpenHIM we will hold discussion on the OpenHIM Developers mailing list, so sign up now if you are interested in keeping up to date.\r\n\r\nWe hope to hear from you soon!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Exposes a single RESTful interface to all infrastructure services\r\n* Ensures communicate between the client and the OpenHIM is secure\r\n* Provides a platform for transaction orchestration\r\n* Provides a platform for transaction translation\r\n* Logs all transaction details and metadata\r\n\r\n## About\r\nThis project was originally developed by [Jembi Health Systems](http://www.jembi.org/) with collaboration with the [HEAL lab](http://cair.za.net/research/groups/heal) at [UKZN](http://ukzn.ac.za/). It was originally developed by Ryan Crichton, senior developer at Jembi Health Systems for the [RHEA project](http://rhea.jembi.org/).\r\n\r\nThis project was funded under PEPFAR's [HI-PPP](http://www.hi-ppp.org) initiative and received input and guidance from many member of the RHEA team. We would like to acknowledge them for their guidance and support.","google":"UA-36213749-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
